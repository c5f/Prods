PHP iRODS
=========

This is a clone of the PHP iRODS client from http://www.irods.org/ that has been modified to use spl_autoload_register() instead of the soon-to-be-deprecated __autoload() function - mostly for Drupal 7 integration.

PRODS can be downloaded as the release tar ball from http://code.google.com/p/extrods/downloads/list. Or you can use public SVN to check out latest code:

    svn checkout http://extrods.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ extrods-read-only
